-Uses a crosshair-based raycast from the center of the screen to select positions
-Allows users to place two markers: one at the base and one at the top
-Measures the distance between the two markers in real-world space
-Converts the measured value from meters to centimeters
-Displays the result on a responsive UI that adjusts to various screen sizes
-Uses custom prefabs for marker and plane visualization
-User interaction is handled through on-screen buttons rather than touch gestures
